# CVW_PyHP
Supplementary material for Cornell CVW on "Python for High Performance"

This repository is intended to support the material contained in the Cornell Virtual Workshop tutorial on <a href="https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python">"Python for High Performance"</a>.

The repository contents include:

* PyPerfWebinar.ipynb  : Jupyter notebook used to deliver the XSEDE webinar on "Python and Performance" on 5/28/2020
* PyPerfWebinar2.ipynb : Jupyter notebook used to deliver the XSEDE webinar on "Python and Performance" on 7/07/2020
* PyPerfWebinar.html   : statically rendered version of Jupyter notebook for 5/28/2020 webinar
* PyPerfWebinar2.html  : statically rendered version of Jupyter notebook for 7/07/2020 webinar
* parallel_pi. py : Python source code for <a href="https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python/exercise">CVW exercise on parallel computation</a>
* images : subfolder containing images that are accessed from within notebooks (.ipynb and .html)
* README.md  : this README file

The two notebook files are very similar, with differences reflecting a reorganization of the slides to move more into the Supplementary material so as to streamline the main part of the presentation.
